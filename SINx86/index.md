# SIN Programming Language

SIN is a procedural programming language that was inspired by C, C++, Python, and 6502 assembly. Its name comes from the Spanish word "sin", meaning "without", because if anyone were to ask you about the language, you'd reply it is without any real utility or practical purpose. I say that because this language is *not* intended to be the new Rust, JavaScript, Python, or whatever your favorite programming language is. It is meant as an educational exercise alone. The language and its compiler are both completely open source in case anyone sees anything useful in it and decides to write another compiler that is at least halfway decent.

## Purpose of this site

The goal of this site is to provide an introduction to using the SIN language and some documentation on its features. It is not meant to be a technical specification, but rather a series of tutorials and informative pages relating to various aspects of the language and its use.
